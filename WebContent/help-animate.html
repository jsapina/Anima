					<dt><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactive stepper / Partial stepper / Forward slicer</dt>
					<dd>Selects the desired inspection strategy, which gets fixed once the B-normalized root of the tree is first expanded and lasts 
					until it is folded, resetting the entire computation tree. The criteria for the partial stepper and forward slicer 
					strategies can be specified by highlighting with the mouse the state symbols of interest directly on the tree (or by executing 
					a query) and then expanding the node.</dd>

					sequence of steps in the corresponding instrumented trace that simulates the Maude step. This 
					facility can be locally accessed by clicking in the plus and minus symbols that respectively 
					adorn the standard/instrumented view of the Maude step, or by checking/unchecking this option

					In the case of a non-instrumented step we cannot, in general, highlight the redex and contractum of the step as they 
					could be spreaded into pieces in the displayed terms because of the matching modulo B that precedes the rewrite step, and the 
					normalization that occurs after the rewrite step. Actually, note that both terms are eventually reordered, 
					augmented with identity elements, and parenthesised, yielding the B-equivalent terms that star in an intermediate 
					rewrite step. In this case, we underline the antecedents in the original term of the reduced redex  
					from its B-equivalent form (and the descendants in the derived, B-normalized term of the corresponding contractum).</dd>
